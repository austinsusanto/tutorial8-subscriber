What is _amqp_?

AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. It is a procedure used by applications to communicate reliably and efficiently.

What it means? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first guest, and what is
the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for?

The first guest refers to the username that will be used for the AMQP and the second guest refers to the password. The localhost:5672 refers to the location where the amqp server is running. In this case, the server is running on the local machine on port 5672.
